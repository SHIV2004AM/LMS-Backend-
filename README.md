# LMS-Backend-
This is the complete backend of a learning management system .
Where i have defined two roles one as a Admin and one as a User . 
As a admin you have access to create , delete , update  courses and as a User you can access theses courses . 
Before that you have to create a account only then you can login and can access all the routes in both the cases (ADMIN and USER ).
